# gpeterson78.github.io
 
**Address:** [www.gradyp.com](https://www.gradyp.com)    
**Version:** 2.5  
**Release Date:** 12-18-2025  
**License:** MIT  

This is a work in progress and not meant for anything but Grady's personal use. But hey, if anything here is useful, feel free.

Explanation - This is the personal site/professional profile of Grady Peterson.  This is setup to be as easy to maintain and update as possible so entirely repo driven, using [github.io Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting.  This site is meant to look like an SSH session since that's where I spend so much of my time.  I've also got a rapidly greying beard so I grew up with green screens.

Current list of features:
- **Quote randomizer** - Quotes can be added to quotes.json with the quote and author and it will display a different quote at random upon each page load.
- **IP tracker** - a little "easter egg" where it displays your current IP as the last logged in IP.  I just did it because it needed something dynamic, nerdy and funny.  Fits the bill.
- **Mobile support** - only because I could not get the 'logo' to stop wrapping on mobile so I substitute a smaller logo and font size for the site.
- **Link easter eggs** - I structured this to look like an output of an "ls -lah" with the 'files' being links.  . and .. needed something meaningful; I think I nailed it.
- **Owner and dates** - all owner and date info included on the links are meaningful.  I don't minor revision for each update, only for feature changes, but I do try to remember to increment the last login date for each update (seconds refer to version number), and the file dates on each link are meaningful as well.  File "owner" tells you where it's hosted, root in the cloud, gradyp is my homelab (lives in my basement).

## Release Notes

- Major = site era / architectural changes
- Minor = feature or functionality changes
- Content updates do not bump version

### Version 2.5

- **Last Login functionality.** Added a little extra easter-egg creepiness.  Totally safe, but feels wrong.
- Been a day.  Site's had a few minor updates with quotes and resume, but no new features so, figured it was about time I fix that.  I have more coming but I like how this little site of mine is shaping up.

### Version 2.4

- Been a while, but on the hunt for my next opportunity so time for a little tidying up.

### Version 2.3

- Smallest of revisions but since I farted it up again, I figured I need to learn my lesson and burn a minor version.

### Version 2.2

- **Cleaned up this file.**  If I'm versioning and keeping comments, I'd better get the format going now.
- I'm locked into this stupid versioning system for now so I need to get slower with these changes and versions.  Should slow down as I mature.

### Version 2.1

- I'm an idiot. May as well do some housecleaning.

### Version 1.5

- **Tooltips added.** A neat little addition to keep the theme, with the logic to hide them on mobile (because who needs tooltips on a phone, right?).
- Honestly, I was ready to jump straight to 2.0 but… I messed up the versioning and need an immediate 2.1.

### Version 1.4

- Embedded YouTube videos. Not a lot, just a few tiny artifacts from my career.

### Version 1.3

- Cleaned up the mess. Added links and a few more quotes.

### Version 1.2

- Mobile support! Font and width shrink for small screens.
