## Release Notes

### Version 2.3

- Smallest of revisions but since I farted it up again, I figured I need to learn my lesson and burn a minor version.

### Version 2.2

- **Cleaned up this file.**  If I'm versioning and keeping comments, I'd better get the format going now.
- I'm locked into this stupid versioning system for now so I need to get slower with these changes and versions.  Should slow down as I mature.

### Version 2.1

- I'm an idiot. May as well do some housecleaning.

### Version 1.5

- **Tooltips added.** A neat little addition to keep the theme, with the logic to hide them on mobile (because who needs tooltips on a phone, right?).
- Honestly, I was ready to jump straight to 2.0 butâ€¦ I messed up the versioning and need an immediate 2.1.

### Version 1.4

- Embedded YouTube videos. Not a lot, just a few tiny artifacts from my career.

### Version 1.3

- Cleaned up the mess. Added links and a few more quotes.

### Version 1.2

- Mobile support! Font and width shrink for small screens.
