## Infrastructure Engineering Leader
_Enterprise Architecture_ \| _Digital Transformations_ \| _Cloud Strategy_ \| _Process Optimization_

---
## Professional Summary

Infrastructure leader who modernizes hybrid environments (on-prem + AWS/Azure), improves reliability and recoverability, and raises operational maturity through clear standards, automation, and pragmatic governance. Experienced leading large migrations, multi-site/platform integration, and security/compliance initiatives.

---
### Key Achievements

- **Infrastructure Modernization.** Reduced operational complexity and lifecycle risk by replacing legacy VMware/SAN stacks with Nutanix HCI in multi-year modernization programs.
- **Cloud & Hybrid Architecture.** Enabled secure cloud adoption by designing hybrid AWS/on-prem architectures (EKS/Fargate + SD-WAN + zero-trust foundations).
- **M&A Integration.** Delivered post-acquisition integration by aligning domains, datacenters, and infrastructure standards across divergent legacy environments.
- **Leadership & Governance.** Served as acting infrastructure manager and architecture leader, guiding cross-functional teams through standards, decision frameworks, and delivery execution.
- **Backup & DR.** Improved recoverability by moving fragile backups to S3-based DR platforms and leading successful recovery after catastrophic failure.
- **Remote Workforce.** Delivered secure remote access at scale via Horizon VDI (1,100+ concurrent users).
- **Security & Compliance.** Reduced audit and operational risk through AD hardening, MFA, least privilege, and compliance delivery (PCI/HIPAA).

## Career Experience

**Senior Infrastructure Engineer \|** [**Howden RE**](https://howdenre.com) **\| April 2024 – Present**  
_Global reinsurance provider_ \| _Global Infrastructure Engineering_

- Own U.S. infrastructure reliability and modernization priorities within global change control, reducing operational risk and improving consistency.
- Lead TigerRisk → Howden integration delivery (domain consolidation, standards alignment, migration sequencing) across cloud and on-prem services.
- Coordinate delivery with global engineering/network/security teams to converge legacy platforms into unified global patterns.
- Reduce knowledge silos by standardizing documentation, onboarding artifacts, and runbooks across regions.
- Serve as senior escalation point for U.S. infrastructure tradeoffs (risk, security, recoverability, and lifecycle).

**Infrastructure Architect \|** [**Western National**](https://wnins.com/) **\| April 2023 – November 2024**  
_Property & casualty insurance carrier_ \| _Infrastructure & Cloud Architecture_
**Scope:** ~100 services | AWS EKS/Fargate | SD-WAN/WAF

- Provided architecture assurance and delivery guidance for a ~100-service migration program by validating designs, surfacing risks, and defining staged execution standards.
- Supported pilot adoption of AWS patterns (EKS/Fargate) and workload placement criteria (EKS vs Fargate vs on-prem).
- Led containerization/integration networking changes end-to-end (SD-WAN, firewall, WAF) for new cloud services.
- Raised supportability by standardizing solution artifacts (diagrams, ownership/SRM, support steps, one-page system overviews).
- Built a usable knowledge system by designing a Confluence structure with consistent per-system documentation expectations.

**IT System Engineer Lead / Acting Infrastructure Manager \|** [**Infinite Campus**](https://www.infinitecampus.com/) **\| February 2020 – April 2023**  
_National K–12 EdTech provider_ \| _Infrastructure Engineering & Operations Leadership_
**Scope:** 2 datacenters | ~4,000 VMs | active/active

- Reduced platform complexity and lifecycle risk by migrating ~4,000 VMs across two active/active datacenters from VMware/Cisco/SAN to Nutanix HCI.
- Enabled S3-based retention and backup modernization by building the company’s first internal S3 platform (Nutanix Objects), later scaled to petabyte-scale usage.
- Managed an 8-person infrastructure team as acting manager (9 months), setting priorities, coordinating roadmaps, and leading incident response.
- Influenced enterprise architecture standards (cloud policy, DR posture, lifecycles, service models) via Architecture Board participation.
- Led multi-week recovery of customer backup systems after catastrophic failure; secured and delivered the transition to S3-based DR.
