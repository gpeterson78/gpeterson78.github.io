**To whom it may concern,**

I am writing to express my interest in the Infrastructure Manager position at [Company Name]. With extensive experience in infrastructure architecture and a passion for leading high-performing teams, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your organization by driving both technical excellence and team development.

Throughout my career, I have found that the most effective way to lead is by **empowering teams to think critically** and approach challenges with clarity. I apply a **Socratic leadership style**, encouraging my team to ask the right questions, collaborate effectively, and arrive at well-considered solutions. This approach has proven invaluable, especially when navigating complex infrastructure projects and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

At **Western National**, I have had the opportunity to guide large-scale infrastructure initiatives, but I find that I thrive most when I am leading a team. My experience at **Infinite Campus** further solidified this passion. During my time there, I led several critical projects, including the successful re-architecture of our infrastructure into a **hyperconverged platform**, which resulted in **$2M in annual savings**. I also spearheaded a **data recovery and modernization project**, transitioning our backup system to a more modern and efficient **S3 platform**.

Perhaps my greatest strength lies in my ability to make **sound judgments** in both technical and team-related matters. I consistently align infrastructure decisions with broader business goals, ensuring that the solutions I propose are not only technically sound but also financially viable. My leadership during the pandemic, where I maintained **100% team retention** and expanded staff, reflects my ability to keep teams motivated and aligned, even in challenging circumstances.

I am excited about the possibility of stepping back into a hands-on leadership role, where I can continue to **mentor and guide a team**, while ensuring that infrastructure decisions are made with foresight and precision. I believe my combination of **technical expertise** and **leadership philosophy** will allow me to make a significant impact at [Company Name].

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and leadership style align with your organizationâ€™s needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

**Sincerely,**
