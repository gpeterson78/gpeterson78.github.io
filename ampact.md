Ampact draft

To whom it may concern, 

I am writing to express my interest in the Infrastructure Manager position at Ampact. Throughout my career in infrastructure architecture and IT leadership, I have always been driven by the desire to make a meaningful contribution. Having spent the last couple years in the insurance industry, I have come to realize that my true passion lies in contributing to organizations that are focused on improving people's lives and serving the greater good.

While I have gained valuable experience managing complex infrastructure projects and leading high-performing teams in sectors such as finance, healthcare and education services, I am now eager to apply my skills in a role that aligns with my long-standing goal of working in the nonprofit space.

At Western National, I have led large-scale infrastructure initiatives, including the migration to AWS EKS and Fargate, and developed hybrid cloud strategies that improved scalability and disaster recovery. Prior to this, at Infinite Campus, I led a team through the successful re-architecture of our infrastructure into a hyperconverged platform and had the pleasure of leading a team of engineers to success through some very difficult times.

One of my greatest strengths is my Socratic leadership style, which empowers teams to think critically and collaboratively arrive at the best solutions. I believe that fostering an environment where every voice is heard is key to building infrastructure that not only meets technical requirements but also aligns with the values and mission of the organization.   

I am deeply motivated by the idea of contributing to an organization that is making a tangible difference in people's lives, and I am excited about the possibility of helping Ampact fulfill its mission through strong, thoughtful infrastructure leadership.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with the goals of your organization.

Sincerely,  

Grady Peterson
